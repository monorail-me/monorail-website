A realtime collection of embedded systems data

A platform where you can:
- Get paid to send realtime sensor data from embedded systems
- Fetch sensor data from the monorail API as a developer
- Support makers

## How it works
monorail exposes an API for developers to
1. send sensor data
2. fetch sensor data
If you send in legitimate sensor information, you'll get paid over time as developers fetch your data. 

## How makers can make money
The monorail API gives consumers free monthly credits to use and fetch data with. If you end up exceeding your monthly limit, it becomes pay-as-you-go. Members who send in sensor information will get paid 90% of the revenue from developers paying for the API. To pay out, all you have to do is connect your banking information with Stripe. You can pay out all of your profit at any time!
